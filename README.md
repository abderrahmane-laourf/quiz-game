# Multi-Language Quiz Project

This project implements a dynamic quiz application using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies:

*   **HTML:** Provides the structure and layout of the quiz interface.
*   **CSS:** Styles the quiz elements for a visually appealing user experience.
*   **JavaScript:** Handles the core quiz logic, user interactions, and potentially fetches questions from external sources (e.g., JSON files or a database).
*   **Python (Optional):**  Used for a back-end component (e.g., using Flask or Django) to manage quiz data, provide an API for questions, or handle user accounts and progress tracking.

## Key Features

*   **Multiple Language Support:** Designed to support quiz content in various languages.
*   **Modular Design:** The code is organized into logical components for easy maintenance and extension.
*   **Customizable Questions:** Questions can be loaded from external data sources (like JSON or a database), making it easy to update or add new quiz content.
*   **Responsive UI:** The quiz interface adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Obtain the project files by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Explore the Code:** Familiarize yourself with the directory structure and the code within the `js`, `html-css`, and `python` (if applicable) folders.
3. **Run the Quiz:**
    *   **Without Python Backend:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    *   **With Python Backend:** Start the Python development server (refer to instructions in the `python` directory) and then access the quiz through the provided URL.

## Contributing
